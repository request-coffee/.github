### Café, Código & Cibersegurança

Request.coffee is a Brazilian cybersecurity company focused on turning complex security challenges into simple, actionable solutions. We operate across three pillars:

1. **Consulting** – Precision pentests, red & blue teaming, secure‑by‑design reviews and employee up‑skilling.
2. **Labs** – A permanent CTF arena and research hub where the community can break things safely and share PoCs.
3. **Software (coming soon)** – Open‑source + commercial tools that automate recon, exploitation and reporting.
